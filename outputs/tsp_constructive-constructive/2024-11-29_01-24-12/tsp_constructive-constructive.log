User Prompt: 
There is a Markdown document that contains Python code along with relevant explanations. A target function `initialize_pheromones` has been selected from this document.
Write a new `initialize_pheromones` for problem:
Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with constructive heuristics. TSP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node.

Function description:
The `initialize_pheromones` function is designed to create a pheromone matrix that serves as the foundation for the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm, particularly in solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The function takes in two inputs: `num_points`, which specifies the number of points (cities) in the problem, and `initial_pheromone`, a float that sets the initial pheromone value for all paths, defaulting to 1.0 if not provided. The output is a two-dimensional NumPy array (matrix) of shape `(num_points, num_points)`, where each element is filled with the specified `initial_pheromone` value, representing the initial level of pheromone on each edge (path) of the graph connecting the cities. This initialization is crucial for guiding the probabilistic path selection process for the ants in the subsequent iterations of the ACO algorithm.

markdown document:
To implement the `search_routine` function using an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm, we'll follow the steps outlined below. ACO is a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of ants, which can be effectively used to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

### Steps to Implement ACO for TSP:
1. **Initialization**: Initialize pheromone trails on the edges of the graph.
2. **Ants' Path Construction**: Each ant constructs a path by probabilistically choosing the next city based on pheromone levels and heuristic information.
3. **Pheromone Update**: Update pheromone levels on the edges based on the paths constructed by the ants.
4. **Termination**: Repeat the process for a specified number of generations and return the best path found.

3. **Pheromone Update**: The `update_pheromones` function updates the pheromone levels based on the paths constructed by the ants.
4. **Main Loop**: The `search_routine` function runs the ACO algorithm for a specified number of generations, updating the pheromone matrix and keeping track of the best path found.

### Test Code:
The test code generates random points, computes the distance matrix, and runs the `search_routine` function to find the optimal path. The best path and its total distance are then printed.To implement the `search_routine` function using an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm, we'll follow the steps outlined below.

Write a new `select_next_city` for problem:
Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with constructive heuristics. TSP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node.

Function description:
The `select_next_city` function is designed to probabilistically determine the next city an ant will visit in the context of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm, which is typically applied to solve optimization problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The function takes several inputs: `current_city`, which is an integer representing the current city where the ant is located; `unvisited_cities`, a NumPy array containing indices of cities that remain to be visited; `pheromone_matrix`, a 2D NumPy array representing the pheromone levels on the edges between the cities; `distance_matrix`, another 2D NumPy array that provides the distances between the cities; and two float parameters, `alpha` and `beta`, that control the influence of pheromone levels and distance information, respectively. The output is an integer representing the index of the next city to visit, selected based on a calculated probability that incorporates both pheromone intensity and heuristic distance information, ultimately allowing the ant to explore promising paths while avoiding less favorable options.

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The `initialize_pheromones` function initializes the pheromone matrix with a constant value.
2. **Ants' Path Construction**: The `construct_ant_path` function constructs a path for each ant starting from a given node. The `select_next_city` function is used to probabilistically choose the next city.
3. **Pheromone Update**: The `update_pheromones` function updates the pheromone levels based on the paths constructed by the ants.
4. **Main Loop**: The `search_routine` function runs the ACO algorithm for a specified number of generations, updating the pheromone matrix and keeping track of the best path found.

### Test Code:
The test code generates random points, computes the distance matrix, and runs the `search_routine` function to find the optimal path. The best path and its total distance are then printed.To implement the `search_routine` function using an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm, we'll follow the steps outlined below. ACO is a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of ants, which can be effectively used to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

### Steps to Implement ACO for TSP:
1. **Initialization**: Initialize pheromone trails on the edges of the graph.
2. **Ants' Path Construction**: Each ant constructs a path by probabilistically choosing the next city based on pheromone levels and heuristic information.
3. **Pheromone Update**: Update pheromone levels on the edges based on the paths constructed by the ants.
4. **Termination**: Repeat the process for a specified number of generations and return the best path found.

User Prompt: 
There is a Markdown document that contains Python code along with relevant explanations. A target function `construct_ant_path` has been selected from this document.
Write a new `construct_ant_path` for problem:
Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with constructive heuristics. TSP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node.

Function description:
The `construct_ant_path` function constructs a path for an ant starting from a specified node in the context of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm, which is typically applied to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The inputs to this function include the starting node (`start_node`), a pheromone matrix (`pheromone_matrix`) representing the intensity of pheromone trails between nodes, a distance matrix (`distance_matrix`) that contains the distances between all pairs of nodes, and two parameters (`alpha` and `beta`) that control the influence of pheromone levels and distances, respectively, when selecting the next city. The output of the function is an array representing the sequence of nodes (cities) visited by the ant during its path construction. The purpose of this function is to enable the probabilistic selection of the next city based on pheromone levels and heuristic information, ultimately guiding the ant through unvisited cities until all cities are included in the path.

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The `initialize_pheromones` function initializes the pheromone matrix with a constant value.
2. **Ants' Path Construction**: The `construct_ant_path` function constructs a path for each ant starting from a given node. The `select_next_city` function is used to probabilistically choose the next city.
3. **Pheromone Update**: The `update_pheromones` function updates the pheromone levels based on the paths constructed by the ants.
4. **Main Loop**: The `search_routine` function runs the ACO algorithm for a specified number of generations, updating the pheromone matrix and keeping track of the best path found.

### Test Code:
The test code generates random points, computes the distance matrix, and runs the `search_routine` function to find the optimal path. The best path and its total distance are then printed.

```python
def construct_ant_path(start_node: int, pheromone_matrix: np.ndarray, distance_matrix: np.ndarray, 
                       alpha: float, beta: float) -> np.ndarray:
    """Construct a path for an ant starting from a given node."""
    num_points = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    path = [start_node]

You are an expert-level algorithm engineer. Your task is to design efficient algorithms that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
There is a Markdown document that contains Python code along with relevant explanations. A target function `update_pheromones` has been selected from this document.
Write a new `update_pheromones` for problem:
Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with constructive heuristics. TSP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node.

Function description:
The `update_pheromones` function is designed to update the pheromone levels on the edges of a graph based on the paths constructed by a set of ants during an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. It takes in five parameters: `pheromone_matrix`, which represents the current levels of pheromones on the edges, `paths`, an array of paths that the ants have taken, `distances`, an array of distances corresponding to those paths, an `evaporation_rate` which determines how much pheromone evaporates over time, and `Q`, a constant that influences the intensity of the pheromone deposited. The output is the updated `pheromone_matrix` after applying evaporation and adding pheromone contributions from the successful paths. The purpose of this function is to enhance the pheromone trail for better paths, thereby guiding future ants to find shorter routes through the graph.

markdown document:
To implement the `search_routine` function using an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm, we'll follow the steps outlined below. ACO is a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of ants, which can be effectively used to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

### Steps to Implement ACO for TSP:
1. **Initialization**: Initialize pheromone trails on the edges of the graph.
2. **Ants' Path Construction**: Each ant constructs a path by probabilistically choosing the next city based on pheromone levels and heuristic information.
3. **Pheromone Update**: Update pheromone levels on the edges based on the paths constructed by the ants.
4. **Termination**: Repeat the process for a specified number of generations and return the best path found.

User Prompt: 
There is a Markdown document that contains Python code along with relevant explanations. A target function `search_routine` has been selected from this document.
Write a new `search_routine` for problem:
Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with constructive heuristics. TSP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node.

Function description:
The `search_routine` function implements the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to find the optimal path for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) given a distance matrix. Its inputs include a callable `cal_total_distance`, which calculates the total distance of a given path, a `distance_matrix` representing the distances between points, a `start_node` indicating the starting point of the tour, and several optional parameters such as `pop_size`, `num_generations`, `mutation_rate`, `alpha`, `beta`, `evaporation_rate`, and `Q` that control various aspects of the ACO process. The function outputs an array representing the best path discovered during the search process. Its primary purpose is to effectively explore possible routes and continually refine pheromone levels to converge on an optimal solution for routing problems in a simulated manner inspired by ant behavior.

markdown document:
To implement the `search_routine` function using an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm, we'll follow the steps outlined below. ACO is a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of ants, which can be effectively used to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

### Steps to Implement ACO for TSP:
1. **Initialization**: Initialize pheromone trails on the edges of the graph.
2. **Ants' Path Construction**: Each ant constructs a path by probabilistically choosing the next city based on pheromone levels and heuristic information.
3. **Pheromone Update**: Update pheromone levels on the edges based on the paths constructed by the ants.
4. **Termination**: Repeat the process for a specified number of generations and return the best path found.

### Explanation:

2. **Ants' Path Construction**: The `construct_ant_path` function constructs a path for each ant starting from a given node. The `select_next_city` function is used to probabilistically choose the next city.
3. **Pheromone Update**: The `update_pheromones` function updates the pheromone levels based on the paths constructed by the ants.
4. **Main Loop**: The `search_routine` function runs the ACO algorithm for a specified number of generations, updating the pheromone matrix and keeping track of the best path found.

### Test Code:
The test code generates random points, computes the distance matrix, and runs the `search_routine` function to find the optimal path.
