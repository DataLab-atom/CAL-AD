1. **Dynamic Mutation Rate**: Adjust `beta` based on fitness improvement.
2. **Elitism**: Preserve best solutions across iterations.
3. **Diverse Crossover**: Use multiple techniques.
4. **Adaptive Selection Pressure**: Vary `alpha` based on population diversity.
5. **Local Search**: Apply after mutation for fine-tuning.
6. **Parallel Evaluation**: Speed up fitness calculations.
