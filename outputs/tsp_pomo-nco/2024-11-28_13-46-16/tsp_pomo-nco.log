System Prompt: 
You are an expert-level algorithm engineer. Your task is to design efficient algorithms that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
There is a Markdown document that contains Python code along with relevant explanations. A target function `search_routine` has been selected from this document.
Write a new `search_routine` for problem:
Assisting in solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with some prior heuristics. TSP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node.

Function description:
The `search_routine` function is designed to utilize a pre-trained model to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) by finding the minimum total distance of a valid route across several episodes. It takes the following inputs: `env`, which represents the TSP environment; `model`, which is the pre-trained TSP model; `episodes`, which indicates how many runs of the search should be executed; `batch_size`, which determines the number of problems processed at once (defaulting to 10); and `aug_factor`, which specifies the augmentation factor for the input data (defaulting to 8). The function returns a float value that represents the average total distance of the minimum valid solutions computed over the specified episodes, thus providing insight into the model's performance in predicting efficient TSP solutions.
