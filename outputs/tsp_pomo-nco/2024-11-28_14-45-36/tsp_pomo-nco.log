User Prompt: 
There is a Markdown document that contains Python code along with relevant explanations. A target function `_run_episode` has been selected from this document.
Write a new `_run_episode` for problem:
Assisting in solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with some prior heuristics. TSP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node.

Function description:
The function `_run_episode` executes a single episode in an environment (an instance of `Env`) using a specified model (an instance of `Model`). Its primary inputs are the `env`, which represents the problem environment, and the `model`, which is used to make selections based on the current state. The function initializes the episode by resetting the environment and preparing the model for inference. During each iteration of the episode, it retrieves the current state, makes a selection with the model, and takes a step in the environment based on that selection, receiving a reward and a done flag that indicates if the episode has concluded. The output of the function is a tensor representing the total reward accumulated during the episode, which can be interpreted as the performance measure of the model's actions within that episode.

Write a new `search_routine` for problem:
Assisting in solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with some prior heuristics. TSP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node.

Function description:
The `search_routine` function is designed to execute the POMO (Policy Optimization for Mixed-Integer Linear Programs) algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). It takes five inputs: `env`, which represents the TSP environment; `model`, referring to a pre-trained model for the TSP; `episodes`, a float indicating the number of episodes to simulate; `batch_size`, an integer defining the size of the problem batch to process; and `aug_factor`, an integer that specifies the augmentation factor for the data. The function performs a series of episodes where it loads problem instances into the environment, runs the model to compute rewards, and accumulates these rewards to evaluate the model's performance. Finally, it returns the average total distance of the minimum valid solution, which is derived from the negative total reward divided by the number of episodes, reflecting the optimization goal of minimizing the distance in the TSP.

    model.to(model.device)  # Ensure model is on the correct device

    env.load_problems(batch_size, aug_factor)
    total_reward = 0

    for _ in range(int(episodes)):
        rewards = _run_episode(env, model)
        total_reward += rewards.mean().item()
        torch.cuda.empty_cache()  # Clear GPU cache

    total_distance = -total_reward / episodes  # Optimization goal is negative reward
    return total_distance

```

Refer to the format of a trivial design above. Be very creative and give `search_routine_v2`. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
