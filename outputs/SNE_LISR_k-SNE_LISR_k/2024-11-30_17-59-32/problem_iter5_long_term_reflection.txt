1. **Hybrid Steps**: Combine Newton-like and gradient descent adaptively.
2. **Dynamic Step Size**: Adjust based on performance and gradient norms.
3. **Gradient Clipping**: Prevent explosion; simplify line search.
4. **Matrix Updates**: Use Sherman-Morrison for efficiency.
5. **Convergence Check**: Focus on position change and gradient norms.
